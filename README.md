# Note Taker App

## Description
    
I wanted to build an app with a simple user interface that allows users to store apps in a JSON file.


I endeavoured on this project as an exercise to become comfortable with using Express to build a server, and use the fs module to read and modify content of a json file for use with a front-end application.


This project solves issues with storing content in a static file, allowing users to have a stored history of notes that they can read and manipulate and update.


In completing this project, I learned how to build a basic service, deploy a project to Heroku, and use the fs module to read and store information for later use.
